# Doctor Lookup

#### This is the project for week 2 of the Epicodus Javascript section, utilizing the BetterDoctor API

#### By Holly Wilkalis

## Description/Specifications

* Enter a medical issue to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.
* Enter a name to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.
* If the query response includes any doctors, the following information should be included about each doctor: first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients (the API provides this data).
* If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification that states what the error is.
* If the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application should return a notification that states that no doctors meet the criteria. (This is not an error so it should be handled separately from any errors.)

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Open your terminal (or other tool you use to access the command line)
* Navigate to the location where you want to save the project folder
* Run command to clone project: $ git clone https://github.com/hollywilkalis/javascript-week-2.git

You are now ready to rock!

## Known Bugs

At this time the search tool only returns one entry per provider - if they practice at multiple clinics or locations, this will only show the first entry.
